bout Me

Hello, I'm Janelle Almonte. With over a decade of experience in the travel industry, specializing in technical support and project management, I bring a strong foundation of skills and knowledge to the table.

## Career Transition

I hold a bachelor's degree in Mass Communication from Far Eastern University and a diploma in Computer Systems Technician from Seneca College. Currently, I work as the International Student Transition Coordinator at Seneca College, while actively pursuing a career transition into the tech industry. I'm dedicated to applying my education and skills in this new field.

## Technical Proficiency

My technical expertise spans various areas, including technical support, project management, CRM (SalesForce, ServiceNow), Splunk, Linux (CentOS, Kali), AWS, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Office, SQL, and Microsoft Server Administration. I'm also working on improving my Python skills to broaden my capabilities.

## Beyond Work

Outside of my professional pursuits, I have a deep passion for travel and have explored 13 countries so far. I enjoy trying new foods and experiencing different cultures. In my leisure time, you'll find me watching crime shows, thrillers, and mind-bending series. I'm also an adventurer at heart and have even gone skydiving on a solo trip.

## Animal Lover

I'm an avid animal lover and share my home with a pet hamster, 5 dogs, and 1 cat.
