# About Me

Hello, I'm Janelle Almonte. With over a decade of experience specializing in technical support and project management.

## Career Transition

I hold a bachelor's degree in Mass Communication from Far Eastern University and a diploma in Computer Systems Technician from Seneca College. Currently, I work as the International Student Transition Coordinator at Seneca College, while actively pursuing a career transition into the tech industry. I'm dedicated to applying my education and skills in this new field.

## Technical Proficiency

My technical expertise spans various areas, including technical support, project management, CRM (SalesForce, ServiceNow), Splunk, Linux (CentOS, Kali), AWS, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Office, SQL, and Microsoft Server Administration. I'm also working on improving my Python skills to broaden my capabilities.

## Beyond Work


Outside of my professional pursuits, I have a deep passion for travel and have explored 13 countries so far. I enjoy trying new foods from different cuisines and experiencing different cultures. In my leisure time, you'll find me watching crime shows, thrillers, and mind-bending series. I'm a fur mom and share my home with a pet hamster. I also have 4 dogs, and 1 cat back in the Philippines and my dream is to bring them all to Canada.
